\usage{
set_priors(yy_s, prior, panelID, timeID, n_states, ms_var, formulas,
  detect.formula)
}
\arguments{
\item{yy_s}{Multivariate time series of standardized data values from data_trans}

\item{prior}{"estimate", "uninformative" or vector of named prior parameter guesses: DCF AR coefficients: phi1 and phi2 only; Error MA coefficients: psi_i1 to psi_i2 only for each series i; Error standard deviation: sigma_i only for each series i; Observation coefficient on DCF with first gamma (gamma_i, ..., gamma_n) only 1 index number, not i0 and any more gammas per equation: gamma_i1 to gamma_ik; Markov switching growth rate: mu_d and mu_u; Transition probabilities: p_dd, p_md (or p_mu), p_mm, p_md (or p_mu), p_uu, p_ud (or p_um)}

\item{panelID}{Column name that identifies the cross section of the data}

\item{timeID}{Column name that identifies the date}

\item{n_states}{Number of states to include in the Markov switching model}

\item{ms_var, }{Logical, T for Markow switching variance, default is F}

\item{formulas}{R formula describing the relationship between each data series, the unobserved dynamic common factor, and the erorr structure}

\item{detect.formula}{Logical, detect lag length of the dynamic common factor to include in each observation equation using the cross correlation function up to a max of 3}
